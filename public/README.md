# Public Assets

This directory contains static files that are served directly by Next.js.

## Usage

Files in this directory can be referenced from the root URL. For example:

- `public/logo.svg` → Available at `/logo.svg`
- `public/images/hero.jpg` → Available at `/images/hero.jpg`

## Current Assets

- Logo and brand assets are in `/assets/brand-logo/` (outside public for now)
- You can move them here if needed for better public access

## Best Practices

1. Optimize images before adding them here
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Organize in subdirectories for better structure
4. Keep file sizes reasonable for web performance
